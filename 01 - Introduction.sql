/*
    In SQL language we have some categories of commands that can be executed.

    DQl – Data Query Language
    DDL – Data Definition Language
    DML – Data Manipulation Language    
    DCL – Data Control Language
    
    Each of the categories has a list of SQL commands that we are going to 
    see and practice with a use case running them on the oracle-xe and at
    the end there will be a challenge.
